# iOS-Inspired Fuzzing Harness (Educational)

This repository contains a minimal Python harness I use to explore fuzzing techniques 
against input parsing libraries. While it is not tied to Apple internal code, the same 
methodology can be extended to test open-source components commonly used in iOS/macOS ecosystems.

## 🚀 Features
- Simple input generator
- Harness for plist/JSON-like parsing
- Logging crashes or anomalies

## 📂 Files
- `fuzz_plist.py` — Example harness using Python to fuzz input parsers.
- `samples/` — Benign example test cases.
- `results.log` — Output file for crash/failure logs.

## 🛡️ Purpose
The goal is to demonstrate fuzzing methodology, not to release real exploits.  
All work is kept safe, reproducible, and responsible.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational research purposes only**.  
No Apple proprietary code or vulnerabilities are included.
