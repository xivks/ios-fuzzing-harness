# Results Summary

**Run date:** 2025-10-02
**Harness:** `fuzz_plist.py`
**Environment:** Windows 11, Python 3.11 (venv), local development box (no vendor code)

**Total iterations:** 200
**OK (parsed successfully):** 3
**CRASH / anomalies (parser exceptions):** 197

---

## Top exception types observed (sampled)

1. `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` — most frequent (empty or invalid JSON input).
2. `Extra data: line 1 column N (char M)` — indicates multiple JSON documents or trailing garbage.
3. `Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)` — malformed/unquoted object keys.
4. `Invalid control character at: line 1 column 6 (char 5)` — unescaped control characters in input.

## Short analysis

* The harness performs aggressive mutations against seed JSON samples; the high crash rate is expected and indicates broad coverage of parser failure modes.
* `Expecting value` suggests many mutated inputs begin with non-JSON tokens (or are empty). `Extra data` shows some mutations create concatenated/top-level garbage that the parser rejects.
* These are **parser-level anomalies** — useful to triage into distinct classes and then reproduce minimally for further investigation.

## Next steps (recommended)

1. Save mutated inputs that cause exceptions locally (into `crash_samples/`) for triage. **Do not** publish raw crash files in the public repo.
2. Run a targeted short job (≈50 iterations) to collect 3–5 representative crash samples for analysis.
3. For each interesting crash, produce a redacted reproduction (screenshot + short repro steps) and add a redacted metadata entry under `bugbounty-reports/accepted/` if it yields an accepted vendor report.

## How this supports an SRD application

* Demonstrates a reproducible methodology (fuzz → record → triage) and documented evidence of experiments.
* Public artifacts (this summary + a small redacted appendix) show capability without exposing raw exploit inputs — exactly the balance SRD reviewers prefer.

## Notes for reviewers

* Tests executed locally against a benign JSON parser to validate methodology and tooling. No proprietary vendor code, customer data, or live systems were targeted.
* Raw mutated inputs and full crash samples are retained privately for analysis and responsible disclosure.
