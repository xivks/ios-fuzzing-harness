# Results Summary

* **Run date:** 2025-10-02
* **Harness:** `fuzz_plist.py`
* **Total iterations:** 200
* **OK (parsed successfully):** 3
* **CRASH / anomalies (parser exceptions):** 197

## Top exception types observed (sampled)

1. `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` — most frequent (indicates empty/invalid JSON input).
2. `Extra data: line 1 column X (char Y)` — indicates multiple JSON documents or trailing garbage.
3. `Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)` — malformed object keys.
4. `Invalid control character at: line 1 column 6 (char 5)` — control characters present without proper escaping.

## Short analysis

* The harness aggressively mutates seed inputs; most mutated samples are not valid JSON and trigger parser exceptions. That behavior is expected for a fuzzing harness and represents useful coverage (many different failure modes discovered).
* The most common exception (`Expecting value`) indicates many mutations produced empty or non-JSON start tokens. `Extra data` indicates concatenation or multiple top-level values.
* These exceptions are *parser-level* anomalies; next steps are to triage distinct exception classes, save representative mutated inputs (locally/private), and attempt controlled reproduction for interesting exceptions.

## Next steps (recommended)

1. Patch the harness to save mutated inputs that cause an exception to `crash_samples/` (keep this directory LOCAL and do **not** push raw samples publicly).
2. Re-run a targeted short run (e.g., 50 iterations) and capture 3–5 crash samples for triage.
3. For any interesting crash (non-trivial parsing behaviour), create a redacted reproduction (screenshot and short steps) and put the redacted summary into `bugbounty-reports/accepted/` if it leads to an accepted report.

## Notes for reviewers

* All tests were executed locally on a benign parser (JSON) to demonstrate methodology. No proprietary Apple or vendor code was used.
* Raw mutated inputs are retained privately for analysis and are not included in public artifacts.
